## INFINITE LOOP DEBUGGING AND POLLING IMPROVEMENTS

### Summary
Enhanced the Game Boy emulator with aggressive infinite loop detection and polling loop breaking to resolve the white screen issue where the emulator gets stuck in hardware register polling loops.

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced Infinite Loop Detection (cpu.cpp)
- **Reduced debug interval**: Check for infinite loops every 1 second instead of 10 seconds
- **Improved loop detection**: Track PC values in a history buffer and detect when stuck in 8-byte regions
- **Real-time polling detection**: Identify when games are polling specific I/O registers (LY, STAT, IF)
- **Aggressive register updates**: Automatically update polled registers to break loops:
  - LY register (0xFF44): Auto-increment scanline counter
  - STAT register (0xFF41): Cycle through LCD modes (0,1,2,3) 
  - IF register (0xFF0F): Set VBlank interrupt flag when needed

#### 2. Aggressive Loop Breaking (cpu.cpp)
- **5-second timeout**: Force interrupts and register updates after 5 seconds in tight loops
- **Multiple interrupt injection**: Force both VBlank and LCDC interrupts simultaneously
- **Register state updates**: Aggressively update LCD registers to simulate hardware changes
- **Debug output**: Show exactly what I/O address is being polled and current values

#### 3. Improved Main Loop Timing (espeon.ino)
- **Realistic VBlank timing**: Generate VBlank interrupts every 16-17ms with slight variation
- **LY register synchronization**: Update scanline register during VBlank generation
- **STAT mode updates**: Set proper LCD mode during VBlank periods
- **More frequent yielding**: Yield every 50 iterations instead of 100 to prevent watchdog

#### 4. Enhanced LCD Cycle Timing (lcd.cpp)
- **Proper LY updates**: Update LY register through mem_write_byte() for proper MMU handling
- **STAT register sync**: Keep STAT register synchronized with actual LCD mode
- **Removed forced timing**: Removed artificial 1ms LY updates that conflicted with natural timing

### Technical Details

#### Loop Detection Algorithm
1. Maintain rolling history of last 10 PC values
2. Calculate min/max range of PC values
3. If range ≤ 8 bytes for multiple cycles, consider it a tight loop
4. Monitor specific opcodes:
   - 0xF0 (LDH A,(n)): Loading from I/O ports
   - 0xD6 (SUB n): Subtract immediate (common in polling loops)
   - 0x20 (JR NZ,n): Jump if not zero (loop back)

#### Register Update Strategy
- **LY (0xFF44)**: Auto-increment 0-153 to simulate scanline progression
- **STAT (0xFF41)**: Cycle through modes 0,1,2,3 to simulate LCD state changes  
- **IF (0xFF0F)**: Set VBlank interrupt flag to break polling loops
- **Multiple interrupts**: Inject VBlank + LCDC interrupts simultaneously

#### Timing Improvements
- VBlank every 16-17ms (realistic 60 FPS)
- Loop breaking after 5 seconds (was 30 seconds)
- Debug output every 1 second (was 10 seconds)
- Yield every 50 cycles (was 100)

### Expected Results
1. **Faster loop detection**: Identify polling loops within 1 second
2. **Aggressive breaking**: Force register changes to break loops within 5 seconds
3. **Better timing**: More realistic LCD timing reduces likelihood of getting stuck
4. **Detailed debugging**: Clear indication of what register is being polled and why

### Build Status
✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - All syntax errors fixed and project compiles cleanly.

Ready for hardware testing to verify the emulator now boots past infinite loops and displays actual Game Boy graphics.
